{"platform": "linkedin", "text": "There was a technical issue at one of the depositories this week that disrupted settlement and had a cascading effect on the market. Since many people may not fully understand how settlement works, let me explain what happened. When you buy or sell stocks, the trade settles on T+1. The Clearing Corporation (CC) determines the net obligations. Meaning who owes shares and who owes money and instructs the depositories (NSDL/CDSL) to move shares between sellers' and buyers' demat accounts via their brokers (Depository Participants). This movement, pay-in from sellers and payout to buyers, is the backbone of settlement. Once complete, the CC knows exactly which obligations were met and which weren't met—these are called short deliveries. On Wednesday, a technical issue affecting inter-depository transfers at one of the depositories disrupted the process, and shares were neither credited nor debited in investor demat accounts for Tuesday's trades. This created a few cascading problems: Without a completed settlement, the CC couldn't identify short deliveries. So if clients who bought shares on Tuesday wanted to sell them, there was no way to know if those shares were actually delivered, potentially causing further short deliveries down the chain. The CC also couldn't conduct auction sessions to resolve existing short delivery obligations. For brokers like us, shares bought by clients were stuck in a pending settlement (T+1) status. Since these couldn't be earmarked at the depository when a sale transaction was made, clients selling these shares couldn't receive their sell credit. The issues persisted through Thursday and Friday, with settlements running slowly and incomplete for trades from those previous days. From what we understand, the backlog is being cleared over the weekend, and things should be back to normal by Monday, hopefully. 🤞", "created_at": "2026-02-08T00:00:00", "id": null, "source": "linkedin_pdf"}

{"platform": "linkedin", "text": "In FY25, around 72% of taxpayers chose the New Tax Regime. At Zerodha, that number was over 90%. This shift makes sense. The new tax regime trades deductions for simpler filing and lower tax rates. For many—especially younger salaried taxpayers, avoiding paperwork-heavy exemptions matters more than maximising deductions. With most deductions removed, salaried employees are left with the ₹75,000 standard deduction and one meaningful tax-saving option: the employer contribution to NPS, commonly called Corporate NPS. Corporate NPS allows employers to contribute up to 14% of an employee’s basic salary (up to ₹7.5 lakh a year), which is fully deductible. It can be structured from existing salary, so employers don’t have to pay extra while employees still get the tax benefit. Employers may also choose to contribute on top, but it isn’t mandatory. We’ve partnered with PensionBox to make Corporate NPS fully digital, simplifying onboarding for HR teams and allowing employees to easily choose contribution levels and equity–debt allocation.

Having said that, if the goal was to reduce speculative activity in F&O, then I'm not sure this will do anything. 95% of trading is already in options, and this STT increase will only push that share higher. Why? Because the impact falls mostly on futures, while options are far more speculative than futures. If the govt wants to reduce speculation, then establishing product suitability (who can trade) criteria is the way to go. I know it's an unpopular opinion, but this will remove a lot of uncertainty among brokers and traders. It's a much better approach than a death by a thousand STT hikes 😬 The other problem with the uncertainty from steady STT hikes is that, at some point, you'll start seeing a material impact on trading volumes because transaction costs make trading unviable.

{"platform": "linkedin", "text": "MTF (margin funding) has grown ~5X in 4 years to ₹110k+ crores, especially after F&O margins and STT increases. But there's something nobody's talking about: there is no real risk model in play for brokers. 😬 Regulations allow up to 5X leverage (20% margin) on many stocks. Competition forces every broker to offer maximum permissible leverage. If you don't, you lose business. Classic race to the bottom. Unlike F&O, MTF has several risk multipliers: Clients hold positions for months vs days 1,300 stocks (many illiquid) allowed vs only the top 200 in F&O All buy positions vs two-way flow in F&O, making risk management much harder Much harder to manage risk, given all the above. By the way, this leverage from MTF becomes insane when you accept stocks as collateral. So, with Rs 1 lakh of stocks, you get a collateral margin of Rs 80k (20% haircut), and with this Rs 80k, you could buy Rs 5 lakh of MTF. The structural problem: Indian equities have decent liquidity when markets rise, but it completely dries up during drawdowns. Minimal short-selling (SLB) means almost no natural bid when things reverse. Forced liquidations become self-reinforcing, especially in non-F&O stocks. SEBI caps MTF at 50% of broker networth + borrowings (or up to 5x networth) to prevent broker defaults. But this potentially protects the system from broker failures, not brokers from client defaults. With MTF growing 5X across the industry and everyone at maximum leverage, the next major correction could trigger synchronized liquidations. We haven't seen a 2008, 2015, or COVID-type event since MTF scaled up. When we do, it will cause mayhem—not because any broker fails, but because forced selling into illiquid markets will cascade. This will be significantly worse beyond the top 200-300 stocks due to lower liquidity. Someone asked me what the risk model is. I said there is none. I mean, there is—if \"praying\" that stocks don't fall counts as a model. 😃 My gut says a lot of what's being earned as interest income, and possibly some capital, of brokers, will all be given back when the market does a quick move down.", "created_at": "2026-01-23T00:00:00", "id": null, "source": "linkedin_pdf"}

Most importantly, AI has dramatically reduced the barriers to experimentation. You can now build and test ideas that would have required entire teams and massive budgets just a few years ago.

{"platform": "linkedin", "text": "One of the lesser-known things about stock brokers is that most brokers don't actually own their entire tech stack. There's usually a third-party vendor providing the core order management system (OMS) and risk management system (RMS). Think of OMS/RMS as being similar to the core banking systems that Infosys or Oracle provides for banks. The OMS/RMS is basically the heart of a broking operation. If this breaks, trading stops. Vendors in our business include Omennest, Kambala, 63 Moons, Rupeeseed, etc. OmneNest, which we use has about a 70 market share. Many brokers are trying to build this tech in-house. We've been working on it for almost four years now. It's extremely hard and complex. More importantly, it involves taking serious risks with your business during the transition. You're migrating live client positions while ensuring nothing breaks. One mistake and you could have trades going wrong, margin calculations failing, or clients unable to exit positions. Constant regulatory changes make this even harder because they need to be incorporated into the system, and each change is a potential breaking point. I think it's much easier for a broker starting from scratch to build their own OMS/RMS than for one that already has established size and scale. When you have lakhs of clients trading daily, you're essentially rebuilding the plane while flying it. Also, it's hard to make tough decisions about important things like this when the incentives aren't aligned. For almost every business using vendors, the debate is: Why bother with the time, effort, and risk to business continuity when no one really cares if you're running the complete tech stack or not? Clients don't ask.

{"platform": "linkedin", "text": "One common reason why traders blow up is because of poor position sizing. In other words, how much do you bet on a trade. You can be right on direction 60% of the time and still lose everything if you size your positions poorly. One oversized trade can wipe out months of gains. This is why position sizing is a big part of risk management. S. Sandeep Rao recently spoke to Tom Basso, one of the original Market Wizards, to discuss his approach to trading. I was listening to the interview and the one thing that stood out to me was how Tom's thinking on position sizing evolved over decades. He started simple: risk the same percentage of equity on every trade, inspired by Larry Hite's philosophy that every bet should be equal in terms of potential loss. But then came a silver trade with explosive volatility. Clients were calling, nervous about the wild swings. So he realized it wasn't just about the amount you could lose—it was also about the speed of movement. High volatility creates psychological stress that leads to poor decisions. So he added a second layer: volatility as a percentage of equity. Now he'd calculate both risk % and volatility %, then take the smaller of the two. Then came the third refinement: margin-to-equity ratios. Some markets have deceptively low risk and volatility but require high margin because of sudden jump risk. By incorporating all three factors, he never got caught overexposed. The result was a position sizing system that automatically scales down when markets get too volatile, protects against margin squeezes, and keeps portfolio risk in check. It's really interesting conversation. Link to the full interview is in the comments.", "created_at": "2026-01-13T00:00:00", "id": null, "source": "linkedin_pdf"}

This leads to what’s called a short delivery. When this happens, the exchange conducts an auction the next day between 2:30 PM and 3:00 PM to settle the trade.

{"platform": "linkedin", "text": "Someone on our team recently asked, \"Why do we only offer Loan Against Securities on Zerodha Capital?\" Why not personal loans or credit cards with their higher interest rates? The simple answer is we can't do anything different there. And our cost of funds doesn't work. We're at ~8.5%, while banks raise money at ~3.5%, and large NBFCs around ~7%. Can't compete on rates, and usually the best borrowers go where the rates are the lowest. Without a rate advantage, we'd only attract borrowers rejected elsewhere, typically those with lower credit scores. Additionally, unsecured lending means recovery agents, constant collection calls, and the entire process of chasing repayments. That's exactly the kind of incentive cycle we don't want to participate in. Also not good for the brand we have built. LAS is fundamentally different. RBI mandates a 50% haircut on securities, making it structurally safer. Borrowers have assets worth at least 2x the loan amount, so we know they can afford it. Lower risk means we can offer lower rates (10-11%). More importantly, it aligns with our philosophy: credit should be used only when genuinely needed and within your means, not just because it's easily available. Our real advantage is that customers already hold securities with Zerodha. LAS is a natural add-on to core broking, not an aggressive lending play. In most markets, brokers don't even need an NBFC license for this. It's essentially a broking function.", "created_at": "2025-12-13T00:00:00", "id": null, "source": "linkedin_pdf"}

When you do that, the financial rewards tend to follow naturally.

{"platform": "linkedin", "text": "The entire Indian financial services industry, including Zerodha, has been a massive beneficiary of the ease of digital onboarding via Aadhaar e-Sign, eKYC, etc. It has been a big reason for the increase in financial inclusion among Tier 2 and 3 cities and rural parts of the country; people who had not previously interacted with the formal financial system. While many of us take the benefits of these digital systems for granted, being in a city like Bengaluru (and a position of privilege), I was surprised by the extent of challenges with OTP verification and the physical/biometric side of these systems until I read articles like these in Epaper TimesofIndia and elsewhere. While digitisation has helped reduce fraud, leakages, and wastage, no single implementation of technology can be perfect. SEBI, for instance, has strict regulations that mandate brokers to offer services via multiple modes, not just a single interface like an app. Biometric devices, in particular, even under ideal conditions, sometimes do not work as intended. The other challenge is with OTPs. People in remote parts of India still struggle with mobile connectivity, leading to delays in verification and the disbursal of benefits. These technological systems tend to affect the poor and vulnerable the most. No technology is perfect, and there are always trade-offs. The trick is to balance out the benefits and potential harms, especially in rural parts of India where most Indians who are economically vulnerable reside. Even minor disruptions to daily lives can have unintended negative side effects, especially when multiple national efforts for financial inclusion and economic upliftment are underway. At Zerodha, we have long been proponents of building technologies to be user-centric with a first-principle, \"graceful degradation\" approach. It becomes exponentially more critical in the case of public technology built for citizen services. It is important that we understand the limitations of various technologies and design carefully planned alternatives that minimize disruptions and preserve the hard-won benefits that these digital systems have accrued to all Indians.

In addition to this, there was a significant decline in market activity. Due to all these factors, our revenues and profits suffered a decline. This year, we are seeing a drop in broking revenues of about ~40%. Having said that, I've never looked at quarterly or even yearly growth because Zerodha is perhaps the only broker in the world with the luxury of thinking long-term and continuing to do what's right for our customers despite short-term business volatility. This is in large part because we don't have any external investors or pressures to answer to. Despite the financial headwinds, the last year was also a good year in a lot of ways.

It determines how well soil holds water, delivers nutrients to plants, maintains structure, and supports the millions of microbes that make soil alive. When SOC drops below 0.5%, you're looking at desert-like conditions where nothing grows without the farmer pumping in fertilisers. India's farmland averages a shocking 0.3% SOC. Compare that to European Union cropland at 1.8%—that's the gold standard. A few weeks ago, Shashi Kumar, the founder of Akshayakalpa Organic(AK), shared something incredible from AK Farms. After years of regenerative practices, they've pushed their SOC up from 0.3% to an average of 1.5% even hitting 2.5% in some spots. They've taken what was essentially barren soil and brought it almost to European levels. What this means is that farmers can use fewer or no chemicals. The food is genuinely more nutritious. And when cows eat fodder grown in this soil, the milk becomes rich in nutrients. This is by far our best investment as Rainmatter by Zerodha, because AK's focus is genuinely on the lives of farmers and their cows.

{"platform": "linkedin", "text": "Someone on Reddit asked what does Zerodha do differently, how are we profitable, why don't IPO etc. This is what I replied: Hmmm... so you forget that we have spent 15 years getting here. And maybe another 10 years, before Zerodha, I was involved in the markets in some form. So, 25 years in all. Things in business compound over time, especially if you like or love what you are doing and if you are lucky to be in the right place and time. When we started Zerodha, we started off as a partnership firm because the exchange deposit requirement was lower, Rs 90 lks compared to Rs 1.5 cr. The start was mainly enabled thanks to the NSE Now trading platform, which came free of cost if you were an NSE broker. For the backoffice piece, sending contract notes, maintaining ledgers, etc., we signed up with a vendor who basically gave it at almost 0 cost. This was provided that we tested out his platform. So the money we have spent on Zerodha is maybe ~Rs 10lks, and that is all the money that has gone into the business till date. Rs 2.5 lks for our website, Rs 5lks for our office interiors (we had an office before), and Rs 2.5 lks for miscellaneous. So, we came from an extremely middle-class background and had no rich uncles. Dad was a bank manager, and Mom taught Veena. 😀 Our rise coincides with India's rise. We were present at the right place and time with the right products and initiatives. Any gyan any founder gives, eventually comes down to getting timing right, and this has got everything to do with luck. I was just reading about Jensen Huang from Nvidia, he survived in the business for 30 years until he hit the right place and time. For a long time, people might have questioned what he was doing until very recently. 😀 😀 Now that there is no pressure to give any exit to any investor, we can continue doing what is right for the customer, sometimes even at the cost of the business. For example, our no spam or no tracking policy. I believe that the philosophy with which we run Zerodha will be our real moat as a business.

By the way, as I've said numerous times before, regulatory risk is by far the biggest risk for brokers like us. This risk is magnified even more because most brokers' earnings are from traders, and they earn almost nothing from investors (like with us). Check the image that shows the drop in exchange option volumes since weekly expiries were reduced to two. They are down by almost 40% in a bull market. Now imagine if the remaining two get removed. We'd be back to 2019 levels more or less. 😬 We earn nothing from investors, either as brokerage or commissions from selling mutual funds.

At a high level, we integrate with multiple stock exchanges, depositories, RTAs, banks, and others. Each of these integrations (hundreds of APIs and file exchanges) has been non-uniform and non-standard, resulting in massive amounts of technical and operational complexity. These are completely invisible to a broker's clients. A great example of quiet, systemic backend work yielding significant impact is the multi-year exercise SEBI undertook to standardise data exchange across market entities—the Unified Distilled File Formats (UDiFF). The same data that was represented inconsistently across three exchanges, for instance, was unified to be consistent in a single format, across numerous data structures. As a result of this, we ended up removing 60%+ of the code that was required to maintain these separate data formats, significantly reducing technical and operational complexity and risk. Along with it, we saw huge efficiency gains. For instance, a nightly data import process went from taking 40 minutes to 30 seconds. Ultimately, this one SEBI project has cleared technical debt accrued over decades, significantly reducing technical and operational risk systemically in Indian capital markets. These boring, invisible, background updates are often far more meaningful, impactful, and directly beneficial to retail clients than most shiny frontend features.

At Zerodha, the STT we collect and pass on to the government is higher than the brokerage we earn. Trading volumes are highly sensitive to the STT. The level of STT also affects whether traders trade more in cash equities, futures, or options. There's a lot of concern that Indian options volumes have exploded; I don't think it would be a stretch to say that STT is a big factor in this. Until 2008, the STT on options was based on contract value, making it impossible for anyone to trade options. After that, STT was charged on the premium, and options became more cost-effective compared to futures, and volumes shot up. By the way, the idea of Zerodha came about when the STT for options was brought down to a premium value. The bet was that people would trade more options. It did play out the way we had thought it would. 😬 We've had several STT changes over the years. This has had a more significant impact on cash and futures than on options because STT was on premium value, and on cash/futures, it was on total value. And yes, the introduction of weekly expiry and restriction on intraday leverage for stocks added a lot of fuel to the fire of option trading volumes. 😃 So yeah, I wish we had no STT, but I guess that's not a solution. But if STT were brought down for cash and futures and intraday leverage were increased (from the minimum 20% now to as much as futures), I think the trading volumes in cash and futures would automatically go up.

The people with money are sticking with us, but many others aren't opening accounts with us . Most likely, the newer and younger, and people from tier 2 and 3 towns, are probably investing elsewhere. 😬 The challenge is that once people pick a platform, they rarely switch.

{"platform": "linkedin", "text": "Interesting experiment by Elm Wealth: 118 finance students were given tomorrow’s WSJ front page 24 hours before the news broke. You’d expect easy profits. Instead, half lost money and 16% went completely bust. It wasn’t because their predictions were wrong. They called market direction correctly 51.5% of the time. That’s better than chance. The problem? Position sizing. Many students bet huge portions of their portfolio on a single trade. Some used 20x, even 60x leverage. When they were right, they made money. But when they were wrong they blew up. All it took was a single misstep. Meanwhile, five experienced traders ran the same simulation. Same info. Very different outcome: +130% average returns. Why? They knew how much to risk. They bet small when uncertain, and big only when the odds were clearly in their favor. That’s the art of position sizing. Here’s the core lesson: Even if you could predict the future, it wouldn’t save you from poor risk management. Trading isn’t just about being right. It’s about surviving long enough to stay in the game. Most retail traders obsess over predictions. But smart money obsesses over how much to bet when they think they’re right—and how to protect themselves when they’re wrong.

{"platform": "linkedin", "text": "One of the biggest challenges in building a financial services business is that the incentives are often skewed toward doing what’s good for the business and not for the customer. It’s very hard to consistently put customers first. This is one of the main reasons why finance apps are full of dark patterns, more than almost any other category. Dark patterns are design tricks used in apps and websites to make you do things that are not in your best interest. From pointless “gamification” and casino-like features to manipulative notifications, lack of transparency, and pushing harmful financial products, many platforms are, in some ways, incentivised to work against their own users. “Show me the incentives, and I'll show you the outcome.” - Charlie Munger One reason Zerodha users trust us with their money is because we’ve avoided these practices from day one.

{"platform": "linkedin", "text": "About MCP and the future of investing and trading in a world of AI: I keep asking K about what all this progress in AI means for our business. It feels to me like we're at the very beginning of a massive shift in how financial services will work. At some point, I think all of it, from investing and trading to banking and payments, will happen through custom AI-powered apps built by users themselves using natural language instructions. In that world, what's the role of a broker? Likely, we'll just be a set of \"pipes\" connecting users to exchanges and back-office systems. The interfaces will mostly be built by users themselves. The only way to stay relevant is to ensure we're the best pipe: fast, efficient, reliable, and invisible when it matters. That's why, over the years, K and the tech team have been obsessively making our systems faster, more scalable, and future-ready. Even if these improvements don't immediately change a customer's trading or reporting experience, we've chosen to fix every possible bottleneck today, not later. Tools like ChatGPT and Claude make it clear this shift isn't an \"if\" but a \"when.\" It might take a few years or a decade, but it's inevitable. Human advisors will still have a role, mainly to help people stick to what these tools recommend. As for how things will evolve, the answer is grey. No one knows. Our approach: stay curious, keep track of the trends, and act where it makes sense. For example, we've intentionally held back on enabling AI-driven order placement. In a future where everything is automated, trust and infrastructure will be our only real moats.

What they have achieved is mind-boggling. They have managed to grow and propagate over 2000 native plant species. To put this in perspective, growing even one wild plant species is extremely difficult. These aren't plants you see in a nursery, almost no one else in the world has done this at their 80-acre scale.

Think about the structure of U.S. markets: dark pools, payment for order flow, and other loopholes that allow hedge funds to make billions off retail investors. None of these practices would be allowed in India, thanks to our regulators. That said, there’s a flip side. Prop trading firms like Jane Street account for nearly 50% of options trading volumes. If they pull back— which seems likely —retail activity (~35%) could take a hit too. So this could be bad news for both exchanges and brokers. The next few days will be telling.

Here are the highlights: For individual traders who code: You can now automate strategies up to 10 orders/second with just a static IP for your API key - no registration needed! Beyond that threshold, you'll need to register with the exchange. For algo vendors: You'll need to register with exchanges to partner with brokers, but once registered, your users won't need individual static IPs. All strategies need exchange registration regardless of order frequency. For brokers like us: We can offer pre-approved algos directly on our platforms, providing more user-friendly automation options. We Zerodha have offered APIs for retail users and startups on for Rs 2000 per month. With this new clarity, the regulatory risk in offering the product is greatly reduced, and so we’re bringing the price down to Rs 500 per month for the data (real-time + historical) APIs. The order placement and account management APIs (view holdings, positions, etc.) have been made free since March of 2025.

This growth was across the board, no matter what metric you look at, from unique investors, turnover, new SIPs, IPOs, to liquidity. 😬 In my 14 years of being a stockbroker, I can confidently say that the Indian stock market has never been more mainstream than it is today.

Remember, India has the highest number of diabetics, and if current trends hold, 30%+ of Indians will be obese. I don't think we have a good understanding of the second-order effects of these weight loss drugs, but so far, the effects people are reporting are remarkable. The obvious effect is that people can lose 15-20% of their weight, as long as they keep taking the drug. But I've also read that the drug can potentially reduce addictive tendencies and compulsive behaviors like alcoholism, smoking, gambling, and so on. There's some evidence to show that these drugs can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, dementia, and Alzheimer's; improve mental health; and so on. I don't know if all of these things are true, and it's early days. But even if half of what's being reported is true, then this will be the closest thing we've seen to a miracle drug. So far, not many people are taking them; even in the US, only about 6% of the people are taking these drugs. With just this, FMCG companies like Walmart are saying that these drugs are affecting purchasing behavior. What would happen if more people started taking these drugs? We'll have an across-the-board effect on every single industry. People will eat less, smoke less, buy less, and live longer. They'll also trade less? Insurance premiums have to change, and annuity payouts in pensions will have to be readjusted. What we don't know is more than what we know about these drugs at this point. Also, the patents on the active ingredient in this drug is expiring in 2026, which means, cheaper generics will be available.

The one common element to their success and longevity is risk management. This has become all the more important in markets like these when fear takes over and having an objective mindset becomes harder. I wanted to share a few insightful tips from an old Jerry Parker podcast: On living to play another day. \"This is a Turtle Rule. That when you have a drawdown, you reduce your positions twice as fast as the drawdown. So, if you’re down 10%, you should reduce your positions by 20% and so on. And that’s a different day when we were trading really large, very few markets, very short-term. But I think it still kind of applies that you want to have that one rule that always works. It’s always going to work. It’s going to keep you from losing too much. And that is just to reduce your positions and live to play another day.\" On cutting your losers and letting your winners ride. \"I used to say, when you have a loss, you’re thinking, I’m hopeful that it’s going to come back and turn into a winner, but that’s when you should be fearful that the loss is going to get bigger. And then the biggest mistake is when we have big profits, we’re very fearful. We’re fearful it’s going to turn into a smaller profit, but that’s when we should be very hopeful that it’s going to be a big, huge winner. So, I think that, you know, we’re always going against the way we’re wired.\" On mistakes. \"But most of that has come from, honestly, from over-trading and not following my systems to a T, as a 100%, as much as I could have. Yeah. So, most of that was all self-induced anxiety. The markets I can kind of get over, I can turn it into a game, I love the game. I love playing and I love competing. But, yeah, that’s the two most important things. And I got that from Rich. I asked him, like, one day, what’s the two biggest mistakes we make? Or what are the biggest mistakes we’re going to make?

Markets are cyclical, and given the way our markets went up from late 2020, this fall was inevitable. I don't know how good the data is, but it seems like the number of investors stopping their SIPs has gone up. This is the wrong thing to do. What an SIP helps you do is to average your investments across different market cycles. You averaged on your way up from 2021; now, you get to average on the way down. In 2020, large, mid, and small caps fell by 25-40% but then rose by 200-400%. If you had panicked, you would have missed the rebound. As long as you invest regularly in the right funds, diversify, and stay disciplined, your chances of long-term success are high. The other mistake to avoid is leverage. There's no shortage of businesses triggering you to borrow money to invest etc., but that's a bad idea. I've no idea where the markets go from here, and neither does anyone.

{"platform": "linkedin", "text": "I saw Knight and Frank's Q4 2024 Global Luxury Market Rankings, and Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru were among the top 15 cities in terms of rise in home price increase. What doesn't get nearly enough attention is the AQI of the three cities. The pricier cities in India have worse air quality, and these are averages for the city; most places have a higher AQI. On a broader note, according to this article in @OurWorldindata, pollution levels broadly seem to follow a U-shaped pattern. In the initial stages of a country's development, pollution levels rise dramatically and then fall as a country develops. This pattern seems to hold across the US, the UK, and China. But despite this, we don't have to accept pollution as a given because of technological advancements; we can do a lot to reduce the obvious sources of pollutants. Take the case of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ). The primary source of SO₂ is burning coal, which makes up about 70% of our energy mix. One obvious way to reduce SO₂ emissions is to install scrubbers in power plants, which helps capture sulfur, which we haven't done in India. Even though China continues to burn record amounts of coal, its sulfur emissions have gone down because of this. In India, both coal use and SO₂ emissions are still rising. It's the same thing with nitrogen oxides (NOₓ). Transportation is the biggest source of the pollutants, and people in urban areas are exposed more to them because of density and congestion. A lot can be done with stricter emission standards, which have historically forced automakers to innovate with technologies like catalytic convertors. Another thing that helps is the electrification of transport fleets. Historically, the U-shaped emissions curve took centuries. Thanks to technological advancements, this can be much faster in the case of developing countries like us. Btw, pollution will eventually feed into prices. Higher pollution means more health issues, and insurance companies are apparently considering increasing health premiums by 10%-15% for people in Delhi. Now think about all the other channels through which pollution will interact with prices and inflation. This is scary.

While demand and supply factors (limited free float) are obvious reasons, there may also be technical factors at play. Let me explain the technical factor. Many traders attempt to short these stocks intraday, expecting a fall, but if the stock hits the upper circuit, they get trapped with no buyers to sell to. This leads to what’s called a short delivery. When this happens, the exchange conducts an auction the next day between 2:30 PM and 3:00 PM to settle the trade. These auctions can happen at a significant premium to the market price. For instance, today Meesho's auction price was ₹258, while the market price at the time was around ₹226. By the way, if you hold these stocks in your demat, you can actually offer your shares directly during this auction window. It’s a great way to exit at a potentially higher price while also helping the exchange settle the trade. We've enabled this on @zerodha—you can participate directly from your holdings.

{"platform": "x", "text": "Someone on our team recently asked, \"Why do we only offer Loan Against Securities on @zerodhacapital?\" Why not personal loans or credit cards with their higher interest rates? The simple answer is we can't do anything different there. And our cost of funds doesn't work. We're at ~8.5%, while banks raise money at ~3.5%, and large NBFCs around ~7%. Can't compete on rates, and usually the best borrowers go where the rates are the lowest. Without a rate advantage, we'd only attract borrowers rejected elsewhere, typically those with lower credit scores. Additionally, unsecured lending means recovery agents, constant collection calls, and the entire process of chasing repayments. That's exactly the kind of incentive cycle we don't want to participate in. Also not good for the brand we have built. LAS is fundamentally different. RBI mandates a 50% haircut on  assets   securities, making it structurally safer. Borrowers  have worth at least 2x the loan amount, so we know they can afford it. Lower risk means we can offer lower rates (10-11%). More importantly, it aligns with our philosophy: credit should be used only when genuinely needed and within your means, not just because it's easily available. Our real advantage is that customers already hold securities with @zerodha. LAS is a natural add-on to core broking, not an aggressive lending play.

Through capital gains, it's just 14.95% (with cess). Why does this matter? Here’s what you should know if you invest in IPOs. If you're an investor (especially a VC), the math is simple: reduce corporate tax by showing minimal profits or losses. Spend (Burn) on acquiring users, build a growth narrative, and then sell shares at a higher valuation while paying much lower tax. This spending also makes it harder for competitors to survive. To be clear, we're not discussing R&D spending here, which, incidentally, is very low in India (0.7% of GDP).     What's often overlooked is that VCs are essentially playing a tax arbitrage game. Look at most VC-backed businesses listed in the last few years, the reason they show little or no profit is partly due to this. Once you run a business this way, it's extremely difficult to switch. Every startup that's 7-8 years old from the time of raising the first round faces constant pressure from VCs for an exit. With almost no M&A opportunities in India, IPO is often the only way out. The government probably designed this tax arbitrage to incentivize companies to spend money and not just accumulate and distribute. But I'm unsure if the balance is correct. I think it's also creating businesses that aren't very resilient. One prolonged market downturn, and many of these unprofitable companies would struggle to survive. Two things that make this more interesting: Unprofitable growth gets valued at much higher multiples than steady profits. A company doing ₹100 cr revenue with 100% growth might get 10-15x, while a profitable one with 20% growth gets 3-5x. So VCs aren't just saving on tax; they're in essence creating a 3x higher exit valuation.

Things in business compound over time, especially if you like or love what you are doing and if you are lucky to be in the right place and time. When we started Zerodha, we started off as a partnership firm because the exchange deposit requirement was lower, Rs 90 lks compared to Rs 1.5 cr. The start was mainly enabled thanks to the NSE Now trading platform, which came free of cost if you were an NSE broker. For the backoffice piece, sending contract  avendor   notes, maintaining ledgers, etc., we signed up with who basically gave it at almost 0 cost.

Rs 2.5 lks for our website, Rs 5lks for our office interiors (we had an office before), and Rs 2.5 lks for miscellaneous. So, we came from an extremely middle-class background and had no rich uncles.

The same data that was represented inconsistently across three exchanges, for instance, was unified to be consistent in a single format, across numerous data structures. As a result of this, we ended up removing 60%+ of the code that was required to maintain these separate data formats, significantly reducing technical and operational complexity and risk. Along with it, we saw huge efficiency gains. For instance, a nightly data import process went from taking 40 minutes to 30 seconds. Ultimately, this one SEBI project has cleared technical debt accrued over decades, significantly reducing technical and operational risk systemically in Indian capital markets. These boring, invisible, background updates are often far more meaningful, impactful, and directly beneficial to retail clients than most shiny frontend features.  very   At @zerodha, we take technical and operational debt seriously. Constantly reducing its buildup and giving these invisible improvements as much importance, if not more, as frontend features, is our engineering philosophy.

{"platform": "x", "text": "Securities Transaction Tax (STT) is the biggest tax that traders pay, and it's much higher than brokerage fees. At Zerodha, the STT we collect and pass on to the government is higher than the brokerage we earn.     Trading volumes are highly sensitive to the STT. The level of STT also affects whether traders trade more in cash equities, futures, or options. There's a lot of concern that Indian options volumes have exploded; I don't think it would be a stretch to say that STT is a big factor in this. Until 2008, the STT on options was based on contract value, making it impossible for anyone to trade options. After that, STT was charged on the premium, and options became more costeffective compared to futures, and volumes shot up. By the way, the idea of @zerodha came about when the STT for options was brought down to a premium value. The bet was that people would trade more options. It did play out the way we had thought it would. 😬 We've had several STT changes over the years. This has had a more significant impact on cash and futures than on options because STT was on premium value, and on cash/futures, it was on total value. And yes, the introduction of weekly expiry and restriction on intraday leverage for stocks added a lot of fuel to the fire of option trading volumes. 😃 So yeah, I wish we had no STT, but I guess that's not a solution. But if STT were brought down for cash and futures and intraday leverage were increased (from the minimum 20% now to as much as futures), I think the trading volumes in cash and futures would automatically go up. It is a much better strategy to increase cash/futures volumes than to reduce trading volumes in options.", "created_at": "7 Aug 2025", "id": null, "source": "nitter_pdf"}

Because of this long-only bias, there's probably very little shortselling talent as well, even if large funds want to start shorting.

What doesn't get nearly enough attention is the AQI of the three cities. The pricier cities in India have worse air quality, and these are averages for the city; most places have a higher AQI. On a broader note, according to this article in @OurWorldInData, pollution levels broadly seem to follow a U- shaped pattern. In the initial stages of a country's development,    pollution levels rise dramatically and then fall as acountry develops. This pattern seems to hold across the US, the UK, and even China. But despite this, we don't have to accept pollution as a given because of technological advancements; we can do a lot to reduce the obvious sources of pollutants. Take the case of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ). The primary source of SO₂ is burning coal, which makes up about 70% of our energy mix. One obvious way to reduce SO₂ emissions is to install scrubbers in power plants, which helps capture sulfur, which we haven't done in India. Even though China continues to burn record amounts of coal, its sulfur emissions have gone down because of this. In India, both coal use and SO₂ emissions are still rising. It's the same thing with nitrogen oxides (NOₓ). Transportation is the biggest source of the pollutants, and people in urban areas are exposed more to them because of density and congestion. A lot can be done with stricter emission standards, which have historically forced automakers to innovate with technologies like catalytic convertors. Another thing that helps is the electrification of transport fleets. Historically, the U-shaped emissions curve took centuries. Thanks to technological advancements, this can be much faster in the case of developing countries like us. Btw, pollution will eventually feed into prices. Higher pollution means more health issues, and insurance companies are apparently considering increasing health premiums by 10%-15% for people in Delhi.

At Zerodha, the STT we collect and pass on to the government is higher than the brokerage we earn. Trading volumes are highly sensitive to the STT. The level of STT also affects whether traders trade more in cash equities, futures, or options. There's a lot of concern that Indian options volumes have exploded; I don't think it would be a stretch to say that STT is a big factor in this. Until 2008, the STT on options was based on contract value, making it impossible for anyone to trade options. After that, STT was charged on the premium, and options became more cost-effective compared to futures, and volumes shot up. By the way, the idea of @zerodha came about when the STT for options was brought down to a premium value. The bet was that people would trade more options. It did play out the way we had thought it would. 😬 We've had several STT changes over the years. This has had a more significant impact on cash and futures than on options because STT was on premium value, and on cash/futures, it was on total value. And yes, the introduction of weekly expiry and restriction on intraday leverage for stocks added a lot of fuel to the fire of option trading volumes. 😃 So yeah, I wish we had no STT, but I guess that's not a solution. But if STT were brought down for cash and futures and intraday leverage were increased (from the minimum 20% now to as much as futures), I think the trading volumes in cash and futures would automatically go up.

If I could go back in time and change one thing, I would've started focusing on diet, nutrition and sleep much earlier. With each passing year, I've been thinking more about health and fitness, and I've been trying to encourage those around me, both personally and at work, to prioritise their health. I've also realised that simple and repeatable behaviours make the biggest difference. It's not about running marathons, living in the gym, or doing Hyrox, or whatever. It's about making small daily choices, such as walking outside instead of doom scrolling, attending a Group fitness class instead of Netflix, opting for grilled over deep-fried, questioning the source of everything you eat, and more. These small decisions, compounded over time, can have a significant impact. Most of us on the core team in the office are health-conscious, which has led to numerous conversations about how we can help others become healthier. That's when we started supporting founders working on making Indians healthier through @rainmatterin. Given the current state of air and water quality in our cities, I've been increasingly thinking about what more we can do. The newest initiative we recently started, @peakst8_club, aims to create offline experiences centred on health.

This applies even if the broker is registered as a research analyst. *However, despite yesterday's circular, brokers' parent companies are allowed to create a \"superapp\" where broking and lending happens side-by-side. This is permissible today because there are no restrictions on the parent entity.* The core concern is that any type of lending or inducement to borrow on a trading platform could lead to borrowed money flowing back into the markets. And unsecured lending is probably the worst; the risk taken can go up exponentially. People can end up trading with leverage they don't fully understand or shouldn't be taking in the first place. Doesn't affect us at Zerodha.

{"platform": "x", "text": "One of the lesser-known things about stock brokers is that most brokers don't actually own their entire tech stack. There's usually a third-party vendor providing the core order management system (OMS) and risk management system (RMS). Think of OMS/RMS as being similar to the core banking systems that Infosys or Oracle provides for banks. The OMS/RMS is basically the heart of a broking operation. If this breaks, trading stops. Vendors in our business include Omennest, Kambala, 63 Moons, Rupeeseed, etc. OmneNest, which we use has about a 70 market share. Many brokers are trying to build this tech in-house. We've been working on it for almost four years now. It's extremely hard and complex. More importantly, it involves taking serious risks with your business during the transition. You're migrating live client positions while ensuring nothing breaks. One mistake and you could have trades going wrong, margin calculations failing, or clients unable to exit positions. Constant regulatory changes make this even harder because they need to be incorporated into the system, and each change is a potential breaking point. I think it's much easier for a broker starting from scratch to build their own OMS/RMS than for one that already has established size and scale. When you have lakhs of clients trading daily, you're essentially rebuilding the plane while flying it. Also, it's hard to make tough decisions about important things like this when the incentives aren't aligned. For almost every business using vendors, the debate is: Why bother with the time, effort, and risk to business continuity when no one really cares if you're running the complete tech stack or not? Clients don't ask. And vendor costs haven't caught up with the phenomenal growth in brokers over the last five years either, so the immediate financial case isn't obvious.", "created_at": "22 Dec 2025", "id": null, "source": "nitter_pdf"}

{"platform": "x", "text": "One common reason why traders blow up is because of poor position sizing. In other words, how much do you bet on a trade. You can be right on direction 60% of the time and still lose everything if you size your positions poorly. One oversized trade can wipe out months of gains. This is why position sizing is a big part of risk management. @mysandz recently spoke to Tom Basso, one of the original Market Wizards, to discuss his approach to trading. I was listening to the interview and the one thing that stood out to me was how Tom's thinking on position sizing evolved over decades. He started simple: risk the same percentage of equity on every trade, inspired    by Larry Hite's philosophy that every bet should be equal in terms ofpotential loss. But then came a silver trade with explosive volatility. Clients were calling, nervous about the wild swings. So he realized it wasn't just about the amount you could lose—it was also about the speed of movement. High volatility creates psychological stress that leads to poor decisions. So he added a second layer: volatility as a percentage of equity. Now he'd calculate both risk % and volatility %, then take the smaller of the two. Then came the third refinement: margin-to-equity ratios. Some markets have deceptively low risk and volatility but require high margin because of sudden jump risk. By incorporating all three factors, he never got caught overexposed. The result was a position sizing system that automatically scales down when markets get too volatile, protects against margin squeezes, and keeps portfolio risk in check. It's really interesting conversation. Link to the full interview is in the comments. Enable hls playback", "created_at": "19 Dec 2025", "id": null, "source": "nitter_pdf"}

{"platform": "x", "text": "I've been noticing many recent IPOs continue running up for 2-3 days after listing. While demand and supply factors (limited free float) are obvious reasons, there may also be technical factors at play. Let me explain the technical factor. Many traders attempt to short these stocks intraday, expecting a fall, but if the stock hits the upper circuit, they get trapped with no buyers to sell to. This leads to what’s called a short delivery. When this happens, the exchange conducts an auction the next day between 2:30 PM and 3:00 PM to settle the trade. These auctions can happen at a significant premium to the market price. For instance, today Meesho's auction price was ₹258, while the market price at the time was around ₹226. By the way, if you hold these stocks in your demat, you can actually offer your shares directly during this auction window. It’s a great way to exit at a potentially higher price while also helping the exchange settle the trade. We've enabled this on @zerodha—you can participate directly from your holdings.

They mapped 249 waste entry points with drones and installed traps. Rerouted sewage to treatment plants and built new ones. Set up a facility for textile waste from factories. Cleaned the river and discovered springs that were buried under debris. Fixed waste collection across the city, removed 170 dump sites. The municipal commissioner joined weekend cleanups himself. Citizens showed up every Saturday. The key was stopping waste from entering the river in the first place, not just cleaning it. If a smaller city can pull this off in 5 years with the municipal corporation, NGOs, and citizens working together, I was wondering if governments, businesses, NGOs, and citizens actually collaborate, can't they make a difference in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and many other cities where the Air quality is really bad.

{"platform": "x", "text": "Someone on our team recently asked, \"Why do we only offer Loan Against Securities on @zerodhacapital?\" Why not personal loans or credit cards with their higher interest rates? The simple answer is we can't do anything different there. And our cost of funds doesn't work. We're at ~8.5%, while banks raise money at ~3.5%, and large NBFCs around ~7%. Can't compete on rates, and usually the best borrowers go where the rates are the lowest. Without a rate advantage, we'd only attract borrowers rejected elsewhere, typically those with lower credit scores. Additionally, unsecured lending means recovery agents, constant collection calls, and the entire process of chasing repayments. That's exactly the kind of incentive cycle we don't want to participate in. Also not good for the brand we have built. LAS is fundamentally different. RBI mandates a 50% haircut on securities, making it structurally safer. Borrowers have assets worth at least 2x the loan amount, so we know they can afford it. Lower risk means we can offer lower rates (10-11%). More importantly, it aligns with our philosophy: credit should be used only when genuinely needed and within your means, not just because it's easily available. Our real advantage is that customers already hold securities with @zerodha. LAS is a natural add-on to core broking, not an aggressive lending play.

One scenario where the buyback becomes attractive is when you have other capital gains that can be offset against these capital losses.

{"platform": "x", "text": "If you take money out of a business as dividends, the effective tax rate is 52% (25% corporate tax + 35.5% on personal income). Through capital gains, it's just 14.95% (with cess). Why does this matter? Here’s what you should know if you invest in IPOs. If you're an investor (especially a VC), the math is simple: reduce corporate tax by showing minimal profits or losses. Spend (Burn) on acquiring users, build a growth narrative, and then sell shares at a higher valuation while paying much lower tax. This spending also makes it harder for competitors to survive. To be clear, we're not discussing R&D spending here, which, incidentally, is very low in India (0.7% of GDP). What's often overlooked is that VCs are essentially playing a tax arbitrage game. Look at most VC-backed businesses listed in the last few years, the reason they show little or no profit is partly due to this. Once you run a business this way, it's extremely difficult to switch. Every startup that's 7-8 years old from the time of raising the first round faces constant pressure from VCs for an exit. With almost no M&A opportunities in India, IPO is often the only way out. The government probably designed this tax arbitrage to incentivize companies to spend money and not just accumulate and distribute. But I'm unsure if the balance is correct. I think it's also creating businesses that aren't very resilient. One prolonged market downturn, and many of these unprofitable companies would struggle to survive. Two things that make this more interesting: Unprofitable growth gets valued at much higher multiples than steady profits. A company doing ₹100 cr revenue with 100% growth might get 10-15x, while a profitable one with 20% growth gets 3-5x. So VCs aren't just saving on tax; they're in essence creating a 3x higher exit valuation. If you're competing against someone burning cash, you almost have to match it to defend market share, even if you don't want to, because of the quirks I mentioned above.  @zerodha Zerodha  Coming soon to Kite: Terminal Mode 31 Oct 2025    ", "created_at": "3 Nov 2025", "id": null, "source": "nitter_pdf"}

However, the easy opportunities are largely gone now. You truly have to do something special to make VC-like returns. Result? A noticeable shift toward more challenging, complex areas, such as deep tech. But this isn't just about VC funding—it's the entire ecosystem developing around it. Cheap Internet has spread talent and aspiration beyond metros into rural India. Better education means more risk-takers, and the growing economy attracts global institutional capital. Entrepreneurship infrastructure is taking shape through centres like Atal Incubation Centres, BIRAC, Venture Centre in Pune, and incubators at IISc, IITs, and other colleges. The good ones have brilliant mentors guiding young founders from idea to viable business. Culturally, entrepreneurship has become aspirational in parts of the country. The funding ecosystem itself is growing. Every wealthy individual now has a \"family office,\" and there's a global rush into VC/PE. Stocks and bonds are boring; private investing is popular among the wealthy. While there's stupidity, it's still net positive. Add smaller angels, founders with exits reinvesting, and corporates like @rainmatterin investing their own money. These factors create feedback loops, building a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem.

While digitisation has helped reduce fraud, leakages, and wastage, no single implementation of technology can be perfect. SEBI, for instance, has strict regulations that mandate brokers to offer services via multiple modes, not just a single interface like an app. Biometric devices, in particular, even under ideal conditions, sometimes do not work as intended. The other challenge is with OTPs. People in remote parts of India still struggle with mobile connectivity, leading to delays in verification and the disbursal of benefits. These technological systems tend to affect the poor and vulnerable the most. No technology is perfect, and there are always trade-offs. The trick is to balance out the benefits and potential harms, especially in rural parts of India where most Indians who are economically vulnerable reside. Even minor disruptions to daily lives can have unintended negative side effects, especially when multiple national efforts for financial inclusion and economic upliftment are underway. At Zerodha, we have long been proponents of building technologies to be usercentric with a first-principle, \"graceful degradation\" approach.

{"platform": "x", "text": "Soil Organic Content (SOC) is critical in farming. It determines how well soil holds water, delivers nutrients to plants, maintains structure, and supports the millions of microbes that make soil alive. When SOC drops below 0.5%, you're looking at desert-like conditions where nothing grows without the farmer pumping in fertilisers. India's farmland averages a shocking 0.3% SOC. Compare that to European Union cropland at 1.8%—that's the gold standard. A few weeks ago, @thiruka (Shashi), the founder of @akshayakalpa (AK), shared something incredible from AK Farms. After years of regenerative practices, they've pushed their SOC up from 0.3% to an average of 1.5% even hitting 2.5% in some spots. They've taken what was essentially barren soil and brought it almost to European levels. What this means is that farmers can use fewer or no chemicals. The food is genuinely more nutritious. And when cows eat fodder grown in this soil, the milk becomes rich in nutrients. This is by far our best investment as @Rainmatterin, because AK's focus is genuinely on the lives of farmers and their cows. The practices they're teaching farmers are rebuilding the soil - which really is the farmer's true wealth. The question now is whether they can scale this sustainably across more farms.", "created_at": "18 Sep 2025", "id": null, "source": "nitter_pdf"}

{"platform": "x", "text": "Someone on Reddit asked what does Zerodha do differently, how are we profitable, why don't IPO etc. This is what I replied: Hmmm... so you forget that we have spent 15 years getting here. And maybe another 10 years, before Zerodha, I was involved in the markets in some form. So, 25 years in all. Things in business compound over time, especially if you like or love what you are doing and if you are lucky to be in the right place and time. When we started Zerodha, we started off as a partnership firm because the exchange deposit requirement was lower, Rs 90 lks compared to Rs 1.5 cr. The start was mainly enabled thanks to the NSE Now trading platform, which came free of cost if you were an NSE broker. For the backoffice piece, sending contract notes, maintaining ledgers, etc., we signed up with a vendor who basically gave it at almost 0 cost. This was provided that we tested out his platform. So the money we have spent on Zerodha is maybe ~Rs 10lks, and that is all the money that has gone into the business till date. Rs 2.5 lks for our website, Rs 5lks for our office interiors (we had an office before), and Rs 2.5 lks for miscellaneous. So, we came from an extremely middle-class background and had no rich uncles. Dad was a bank manager, and Mom taught Veena. 😀 Our rise coincides with India's rise. We were present at the right place and time with the right products and initiatives. Any gyan any founder gives, eventually comes down to getting timing right, and this has got everything to do with luck. I was just reading about Jensen Huang from Nvidia, he survived in the business for 30 years until he hit the right place and time. For a long time, people might have questioned what he was doing until very recently. 😀 😀 Now that there is no pressure to give any exit to any investor, we can continue doing what is right for the customer, sometimes even at the cost of the business. For example, our no spam or no tracking policy. I believe that the philosophy with which we run Zerodha will be our real moat as a business.

I am as clueless as everybody else. 😃 Having said that, I would not be surprised if they were banned completely, and/or if there is some product suitability framework that makes it harder for people to trade F&O. By the way, as I've said numerous times before, regulatory risk is by far the biggest risk for brokers like us. This risk is magnified even more because most brokers' earnings are from traders, and they earn almost nothing from investors (like with us). Check the image that shows the drop in exchange option volumes since weekly expiries were reduced to two. They are down by almost 40% in a bull market. Now imagine if the remaining two get removed. We'd be back to 2019 levels more or less. 😬 We earn nothing from investors, either as brokerage or commissions from selling mutual funds. The more I think about it, we are just biding time before we will be forced to make a change. What do I personally think about weekly option expiries? As the CEO of a brokerage firm, I would say weekly expiries with a product suitability framework sound reasonable to me. But if I were an outsider to the broking industry, I would understand the logic behind completely removing weekly expiries.

People often look at the number of contracts traded, not the premiums or the actual value involved. If anything, India is significantly less leveraged than the US, even taking into account the fact that our markets are 15–20 years behind theirs. Consider this: in the US, the margin funding market (the equivalent of MTF in India) recently crossed $1 trillion. In India, it’s still under $10 billion—just 1% of that. Similarly, US stocks shorted are estimated to be another $1 trillion, while in India, the stock lending and borrowing market remains practically insignificant. Calling the US a gambling society wouldn’t be unfair. Just recently, there were bets totaling $210 million on whether Zelensky would wear a suit at the NATO summit. 🙂 If you compare our leverage as a country to that of the US, we’re a mere drop in the ocean.

I had to physically fill out the delivery instruction slips and send them to the broker to move holdings to my primary demat and then sell them.

At a high level, we integrate with multiple stock exchanges, depositories, RTAs, banks, and others. Each of these integrations (hundreds of APIs and file exchanges) has been non-uniform and non-standard, resulting in massive amounts of technical and operational complexity. These are completely invisible to a broker's clients. A great example of quiet, systemic backend work yielding significant impact is the multi-year exercise SEBI undertook to standardise data exchange across market entities—the Unified Distilled File Formats (UDiFF). The same data that was represented inconsistently across three exchanges, for instance, was unified to be consistent in a single format, across numerous data structures. As a result of this, we ended up removing 60%+ of the code that was required to maintain these separate data formats, significantly reducing technical and operational complexity and risk. Along with it, we saw huge efficiency gains. For instance, a nightly data import process went from taking 40 minutes to 30 seconds. Ultimately, this one SEBI project has cleared technical debt accrued over decades, significantly reducing technical and operational risk systemically in Indian capital markets. These boring, invisible, background updates are often far more meaningful, impactful, and directly beneficial to retail clients than most shiny frontend features. At @zerodha, we take technical and operational debt very seriously.

Instead, half lost money and 16% went completely bust. It wasn’t because their predictions were wrong. They called market direction correctly 51.5% of the time. That’s better than chance. The problem? Position sizing. Many students bet huge portions of their portfolio on a single trade. Some used 20x, even 60x leverage. When they were right, they made money. But when they were wrong they blew up. All it took was a single misstep. Meanwhile, five experienced traders ran the same simulation. Same info. Very different outcome: +130% average returns. Why? They knew how much to risk. They bet small when uncertain, and big only when the odds were clearly in their favor. That’s the art of position sizing. Here’s the core lesson: Even if you could predict the future, it wouldn’t save you from poor risk management. Trading isn’t just about being right. It’s about surviving long enough to stay in the game. Most retail traders obsess over predictions. But smart money obsesses over how much to bet when they think they’re right—and how to protect themselves when they’re wrong.

Unless we make shorting of stocks easy in the Indian markets, price discovery will be impaired. India has been a structurally long-only market with almost no shorting activity, because borrowing stock to short is really hard and is an offline process. Because of this long-only bias, there's probably very little short-selling talent as well, even if large funds want to start shorting. The only real way to short stocks until now was to use futures, maybe options. But there are only 224 F&O stocks, which means you can't short the vast majority of the problematic stocks. Also, these contracts expire every month, and the cost of rolling over these contracts is significant (only the 1st month contract is liquid). Unless this changes, there will always be weird distortions in the prices of Indian markets. Short sellers, although they have a bad reputation, are massively underrated. Think of them as janitors; they clean up all the garbage in the markets and make them more efficient. Securities lending and borrowing (SLB) is still an offline process, and most brokers don't offer an online option. Like everyone, we at @zerodha offer it, but you'll have to call us to borrow or lend, and there's a process, which means it'll never scale.

Dark patterns are design tricks used in apps and websites to make you do things that are not in your best interest.

{"platform": "x", "text": "It's amazing that despite all the challenges, we're now the 4th largest economy in the world. Having said that, at the risk of sounding like a spoilsport, GDP comparisons only tell you so much. When you look at important metrics like productivity, labor force participation, and perhaps most importantly, R&D spending, we have a long way to go. India spends just 0.7% of GDP on R&D, while China spends 2.4%, South Korea 4.8%, and Israel 6%. To continue growing in an increasingly fragmented world and an uncertain future that might be shaped by AI, I'm not sure we can continue doing what we've done so far. One of the biggest long-term challenges for Indian growth is this chronically low R&D spending. To be clear, this is both a government problem and a private sector problem as data shows. It's unfair to expect the government alone to solve this. All the giving back we do through @rainmatterin is, in part, with this objective. Unless we build an ecosystem that invests in education and research, not only will our best minds leave India, but higher long-term growth rates will remain out of reach. We'll also miss out on taking advantage of our demographic dividend. This isn't an easy fix. It requires long-term efforts to transform education, streamline regulations, and create an environment with the right incentives for India's brightest minds to discover and build in India, for India. Without this, we'll never truly realize our potential.", "created_at": "27 May 2025", "id": null, "source": "nitter_pdf"}

We are optimistic about this new technology at the same time cognizant about the potential risks. To quote K from a recent post he wrote about MCPs: \"Strictly from a user perspective, it feels liberating to be able to access services outside of their walled gardens and bloated UIs riddled with dark patterns. It moves a considerable amount of control from service providers to users, but at the same time, it concentrates decision-making and mediation in the hands of AI blackboxes. What about errors and failures with real-world implications that occur in the midst of AI orchestration across critical services? How would those be debugged and traced? How would accountability be established? Will regulations and governance models emerge for AI-mediated automagical actions across services?

Remember, India has the highest number of diabetics, and if current trends hold, 30%+ of Indians will be obese. I don't think we have a good understanding of the second-order effects of these weight loss drugs, but so far, the effects people are reporting are remarkable. The obvious effect is that people can lose 15-20% of their weight, as long as they keep taking the drug. But I've also read that the drug can potentially reduce addictive tendencies and compulsive behaviors like alcoholism, smoking, gambling, and so on. There's some evidence to show that these drugs can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, dementia, and Alzheimer's; improve mental health; and so on. I don't know if all of these things are true, and it's early days. But even if half of what's being reported is true, then this will be the closest thing we've seen to a miracle drug. So far, not many people are taking them; even in the US, only about 6% of the people are taking these drugs. With just this, FMCG companies like Walmart are saying that these drugs are affecting purchasing behavior. What would happen if more people started taking these drugs? We'll have an across-theboard effect on every single industry. 😬 People will eat less, smoke less, buy less, and live longer. They'll also trade less? Insurance premiums have to change, and annuity payouts in pensions will have to be readjusted. What we don't know is more than what we know about these drugs at this point.

The one common element to their success and longevity is risk management. This has become all the more important in markets like these when fear takes over and having an objective mindset becomes harder. I wanted to share a few insightful tips from an old @rjpjr12 podcast: On living to play another day. \"This is a Turtle Rule. That when you have a drawdown, you reduce your positions twice as fast as the drawdown. So, if you’re down 10%, you should reduce your positions by 20% and so on. And that’s a different day when we were trading really large, very few markets, very short-term. But I think it still kind of applies that you want to have that one rule that always works. It’s always going to work. It’s going to keep you from losing too much. And that is just to reduce your positions and live to play another day.\" On cutting your losers and letting your winners ride. \"I used to say, when you have a loss, you’re thinking, I’m hopeful that it’s going to come back and turn into a winner, but that’s when you should be fearful that the loss is going to get bigger. And then the biggest mistake is when we have big profits, we’re very fearful. We’re fearful it’s going to turn into a smaller profit, but that’s when we should be very hopeful that it’s going to be a big, huge winner. So, I think that, you know, we’re always going against the way we’re wired.\" On mistakes. \"But most of that has come from, honestly, from over-trading and not following my systems to a T, as a 100%, as much as I could have. Yeah. So, most of that was all self-induced anxiety. The markets I can kind of get over, I can turn it into a game, I love the game. I love playing and I love competing. But, yeah, that’s the two most important things. And I got that from Rich. I asked him, like, one day, what’s the two biggest mistakes we make? Or what are the biggest mistakes we’re going to make?

{"platform": "x", "text": "For investors who started investing after the pandemic, this is the first real market correction. Markets are cyclical, and given the way our markets went up from late 2020, this fall was inevitable. I don't know how good the data is, but it seems like the number of investors stopping their SIPs has gone up. This is the wrong thing to do. What an SIP helps you do is to average your investments across different market cycles. You averaged on your way up from 2021; now, you get to average on the way down. In 2020, large, mid, and small caps fell by 25-40% but then rose by 200400%. If you had panicked, you would have missed the rebound. As long as you invest regularly in the right funds, diversify, and stay disciplined, your chances of long-term success are high. The other mistake to avoid is leverage. There's no shortage of businesses triggering you to borrow money to invest etc., but that's a bad idea. I've no idea where the markets go from here, and neither does anyone. What I do know is panicking now is the wrong thing to do, and you can get pushed to panic if you have borrowed.

{"platform": "x", "text": "I saw Knight and Frank's Q4 2024 Global Luxury Market Rankings, and Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru were among the top 15 cities in terms of rise in home price increase. What doesn't get nearly enough attention is the AQI of the three cities. The pricier cities in India have worse air quality, and these are averages for the city; most places have a higher AQI. On a broader note, according to this article in @OurWorldInData, pollution levels broadly seem to follow a U-shaped pattern. In the initial stages of a country's development, pollution levels rise dramatically and then fall as a country develops. This pattern seems to hold across the US, the UK, and even China. But despite this, we don't have to accept pollution as a given because of technological advancements; we can do a lot to reduce the obvious sources of pollutants. Take the case of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ). The primary source of SO₂ is burning coal, which makes up about 70% of our energy mix. One obvious way to reduce SO₂ emissions is to install scrubbers in power plants, which helps capture sulfur, which we haven't done in India. Even though China continues to burn record amounts of coal, its sulfur emissions have gone down because of this. In India, both coal use and SO₂ emissions are still rising. It's the same thing with nitrogen oxides (NOₓ). Transportation is the biggest source of the pollutants, and people in urban areas are exposed more to them because of density and congestion. A lot can be done with stricter emission standards, which have historically forced automakers to innovate with technologies like catalytic convertors. Another thing that helps is the electrification of transport fleets. Historically, the U-shaped emissions curve took centuries. Thanks to technological advancements, this can be much faster in the case of developing countries like us. Btw, pollution will eventually feed into prices. Higher pollution means more health issues, and insurance companies are apparently considering increasing health premiums by 10%-15% for people in Delhi. Now think about all the other channels through which pollution will interact with prices and inflation. This is scary.", "created_at": "24 Feb 2025", "id": null, "source": "nitter_pdf"}

{"platform": "x", "text": "😬 Something I learned recently on why ETFs in the US are preferred over MFs. US mutual funds are pass-through vehicles—if they generate capital gains, these must be distributed to unit holders who pay the taxes on the gains which makes MFs less tax-efficient. ETFs avoid this through 'in-kind' creation/redemption that washes away gains. This tax advantage is significant. This is one underrated reason for the popularity of index funds, especially ETFs in the US.
